Snake-Water-Gun Game
A simple Python command-line game based on the traditional game of Snake-Water-Gun (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors). The game allows the user to choose between three options: Snake, Water, and Gun, and pits them against a randomly selected choice from the computer.

Game Rules
Snake (s) defeats Water (w) but loses to Gun (g).
Water (w) defeats Gun (g) but loses to Snake (s).
Gun (g) defeats Snake (s) but loses to Water (w).
How to Play
Run the Python script.
Input your choice when prompted:
s for Snake
w for Water
g for Gun
The computer will randomly choose one option.
The result will be displayed: either a Win, Lose, or Draw based on your choice and the computer's choice.
